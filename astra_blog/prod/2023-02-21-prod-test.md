# 2. How Astra solves it

Using blockchain, Astra Rewards aims to solve that fundamental problem by building a global decentralized reward program that any participating organizations and users can authenticate, verify all the reward points and transactions themselves and ensure the immunity, integrity, transparency of their reward program and others without worrying any single entity can control and manipulate the rewards.

This will create a strong motivation and peace of mind to participate in such a transparent, immutable reward program, which in turn increases liquidity, use-cases and network effect of the reward program.

## 2.1 What is Astra Chain?

Astra is much more than a reward point/program but a technology, infrastructure and network that can potentially power millions of businesses, billions of users to reward, transact, exchange multiple reward tokens in a secure, transparent, trustless and permissionless manner.

* Users & Reward Providers to join the reward program instantly without the need of heavy investment, tech team or complicated system
* Allow anyone to build useful applications on top of the network that bring additional reward/loyalty-related features to users and businesses
